# This software was developed in an Ubuntu Linux environment using the IntelliJ
# IDE, java 11, and the Jetbrains java annotations. These basic instructions
# for building the software presuppose a Linux build environment, and a java
# installation at version 11 or higher. You will also need Apache Ant. Ant may
# be installed in Ubuntu Linux with the command:
#
# sudo apt install ant
#
# To build the software, you will also need the annotations-20.1.0.jar at the
# following relative path:
#
# .../org/jetbrains/annotations/20.1.0/annotations-20.1.0.jar
#
# The relative path was preserved so that the build.xml file for ant would not
# need to be modified. The build.xml file (in this same directory) and the
# properties file were generated using IntelliJ, and the Ant Build Generation
# plugin, ver. 203.4. The aforementioned annotations jar is available online,
# or from an IntelliJ installation.
#
# Add the absolute path for the above relative path that contains the
# annotations jar. Do this in the line below in place of the '?'.
path.variable.maven_repository=?
# Add the absolute path to your java development kit, version 11 or higher in
# the line below in place of the '?'.

# Ant should now be able to build the software in Linux. Building the software
# in MacOS or Windows - if desirable - is left as an exercise for the
# developer.
