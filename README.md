# Rebalance

A Java Project to Rebalance Investment Portfolios

The Rebalance Project is one that I undertook beginning in February 2022. It is a Java-based, command-line software tool that rebalances the investment holdings of one or more investors. The tool is currently driven by a series of comma-separated files (csv's). The tool will rebalance the portfolio holdings of each investor across institutions, accounts, mutual funds, ETFs and individual securities based on declared weight preferences.

Output from the tool is a series of text files for each investor:

1. A report of the current state of the portfolio
2. A report of the state of the portfolio after proposed changes
3. A file that shows currency differences between current and proposed holdings
4. A file that describes the reallocation actions required to effect the proposed changes   

### Motivation

I have been interested in investing and investments for many years, and have sought throughout my professional career to save and invest diligently. During that time, I have periodically undertaken the task of rebalancing my personal investments using spreadsheets and a calculator. I found this to be an imprecise, tedious, and error-prone task. 

### Why this Project?

Beginning at the end of calendar year 2020, I changed my career focus from full-time employment and contract assignments to a long term status as a freelance software developer and data scientist. In my capacity in this role, I undertook this project for two reasons. First, I desired a mostly automated tool to undertake the chore of rebalancing my investments. Second, I desired to showcase a large, publicly accessible software project that was conceived, designed, coded and documented solely by myself.

In service of both goals, I decided to produce my own custom tool for the task rather than research utilities that might be commercially available, or open-source software. Reputable commercial software might have been a trustworthy choice for the task. I rejected this option for two reasons: 1) first, the expense, and; 2) the feeling that it might not be precisely what I needed. Open-source software from other developers might have been available. I also rejected this option for two reasons: 1) the legwork required to research the options, and; 2) less trust in the work of others. 

### Input

The input to the tool is a series of sixteen CSV files that are coded by date in their names (format: yyyymmdd). Sample files are located in the data directory of this project. There you will find a series of subdirectories. Some subdirectories contain one or more input files of the same type, differing by date, or one or more output files differing by date.
These sixteen input files are:

1. Account: A description of accounts unique by institution and account number
2. Basis: A hierarchy of expenses used for calculating capital gains tax
3. Code: A description of single-character alphabetic codes used internally by the tool
4. Detailed: Fine-grained weight preferences specific to account
5. Distinguished: Key-value pairs that map programmatically accessible keys to sensitive portfolio keys, institution names, and account numbers
6. Holdings: The most important file, a hierarchy of holding valuations organized by portfolios, institutions, accounts, and securities
7. Capital Gains Tax Rates (4 files): Current capital gains tax rates, one file for each of head-of-household, joint, separate and single filers
8. Income Tax Rates (4 files): Current income tax rates, one file for each of head-of-household, joint, separate and single filers
9. Portfolio: A description of portfolios unique by a key
10. Ticker: A description of tickers unique by key (funds, ETFs or individual security) that describe the type of securities held (e.g., stock, bond, cash or real estate)

As well as sample data files, the reader will also find in each data subdirectory a text file describing in column order the fields in the CSV files of that type. Each row in the CSV files of the given type is assumed to have a unique key. The key field(s) are so indicated in the description file. 

I have left as an enhancement the possibility that input to the tool may be changed to SQL tables indexed by a combination of date, and existing keys in the CSV files. An additional enhancement would be a graphical user interface by which the SQL tables may be edited. The current tool does not have these features.

### License

License of this project and the resulting tool is covered by the GNU General Public License v3.0. 

### State of the Project

After approximately 13 months of work, I have deemed the design, code and deployment activities of the project to be complete. I have allocated one man-month to fully document the project for professional showcase. My intention is to complete this work by the conclusion of March 2022. An observer will note progressive activity and growth in this markdown file and related documents during this time. Below you will find the portions of the markdown template that remain unedited. Stop by often for updates!

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
