Things to do:

1. Add a boolean field to the Account file specifying that rebalance should be
   governed by ticker weights in the Holding file, bypassing category weights
   in the Account and Detailed files.

2. Add a section on how rebalancing works in the README.md.

3. Do code metrics, and report in the README.md.

4. Add other sections to the README.md as needed.

For your information:

   Account: Does not use optional field processors; builds type percentages
   directly.

   Code: Uses specific field processors for mnemonic and description, and an
   array of field processors for the four subcode fields, indexed zero through
   last index.

   Detailed: Does not use optional field processors; builds type percentages
   directly.

   HoldingType: Specific field processors for name, shares, price and value.

   Portfolio: Uses an array of field processors for percentages, indexed zero
   through last index.

   Ticker: Uses a single field processor for each of the four possible fund
   subtypes.
