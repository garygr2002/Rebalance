Things to do:

I had used this file to track my next tasks from day-to-day while working on
this project from February 2021 through March 2022. I have now summarized
possible enhancements for major version 2 of the software, but they are not
included here. I have written them in the section entitled "Room for
Enhancement" in the README.md file. Reference that document.

Below are other notes that I had kept here as I worked...

For your information:

   Account: Does not use optional field processors; builds type percentages
   directly.

   Code: Uses specific field processors for mnemonic and description, and an
   array of field processors for the four subcode fields, indexed zero through
   last index.

   Detailed: Does not use optional field processors; builds type percentages
   directly.

   HoldingType: Specific field processors for name, shares, price and value.

   Portfolio: Uses an array of field processors for percentages, indexed zero
   through last index.

   Ticker: Uses a single field processor for each of the four possible fund
   subtypes.

Notes on capital gains tax on real-estate sale:

Wrong way - Formula for capital gains tax: Sale price average of $998,950.50
minus mortgage value of $218,598.38 minus price paid $396,300.00 minus
exclusion of $250.000.00. From this, take 15%. Total is $20,107.82.
