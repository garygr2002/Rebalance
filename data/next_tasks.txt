2. In README.md, create links for all CSV files no matter they are mentioned in
   the text.

3. In README.md, create links for all CSV file fields (they are unique now; see
   item 1) no matter where they are mentioned in the text.

4. Add a section on how rebalancing works in the README.md.

5. Do code metrics, and report in the README.md.

6. Create section for tools used in README.md.
