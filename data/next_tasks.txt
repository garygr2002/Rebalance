Things to do:

1. Try to clone git repository on old Linux notebook, and the MacBook. Ensure
   proper Java version is present on each, acquire the annotations jar for
   each, modify the build properties file and try to build the project on each.
   Make notes as you go.

2. Create build instructions for project for Linux and MacOS (Windows
   build instructions will require PC rental) based on notes from step 1.

3. See if the executable jar that was checked in actually runs on the Linux
   notebook, and the MacBook.

4. Try to replicate steps 1 through 3 on a rental PC with Windows installed.

5. Create git repository documentation, including instructions for project
   download, build and run. Goal is to call project completion by end of
   March 2022.
