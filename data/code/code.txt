The code file contains descriptions of single-character codes that refer to one
of two overloaded meanings: 1) the portfolio, institution, account, ticker
hierarchy of investment classification, or; 2) a mapping to specific categories
of fund types. This file may be used for whatever programmatic purposes are
desirable.

Description of CSV files in format code_yyyymmdd.csv (identified by year, month
and day of file generation, as noted)

Note: Until alignment ends, integral fields may be left-padded with zeros or
blanks, as noted. Unconstrained types, enumerated types, and floating point
types are padded neither left nor right. Integral and floating point fields are
aligned-right. Unconstrained and enumerated types are left-aligned.
