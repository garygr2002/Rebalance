This directory will contain subdirectories for all investors named in the
portfolio file. For each investor, there will be files of the form
report_yyyymmdd.txt that contain readable, pre-rebalance reports about the
portfolio of each investor. The report balances should be identical to those
contained in corresponding 'proposed' files (post-rebalance), although the
distribution of assets among investment classes may (probably will) be
different.
