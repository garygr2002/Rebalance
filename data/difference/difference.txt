This directory will contain subdirectories for all investors named in the
portfolio file. For each investor, there will be files of the form
difference_yyyymmdd.txt that contain the holdings in the same format as the
holdings file of the same date. The trailing numeric columns for each row
will give the post-rebalance value for the corresponding holding, its pre-
rebalance value, and the difference between the two. Each holding row
corresponds to a portfolio, institution, account or ticker in a nested
hierarchy. It is intended that the difference for the holding row for
portfolios, institutions or accounts never be anything but zero. The
differences for tickers may be non-zero so long as they have a zero difference
in the account where they reside. This file is suitable to be parsed as a
comma-separated value file.
