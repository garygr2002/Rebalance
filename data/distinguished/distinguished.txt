The distinguished file contains maps of programmatically-usable key names to
actual (and presumably sensitive) portfolio, institution, or account keys that
should not be hard-coded, and visible in a public code base (such as GitHub). A
query of the distinguished library using a programmatically-usable key will
make the sensitive information available at program execution using the
sensitive data files from which they were read. This data file is organized as
a hierarchy. All accounts are assumed contained in the most recently declared
institution, and all institutions are assumed held in the most recently
declared portfolio.

Description of CSV files in format distinguished_yyyymmdd.csv (identified by
year, month and day of file generation, as noted)

Note: Until alignment ends, integral fields may be left-padded with zeros or
blanks, as noted. Unconstrained types, enumerated types, and floating point
types are padded neither left nor right. Integral and floating point fields are
aligned-right. Unconstrained and enumerated types are left-aligned.

 1. Distinguished Type: length - 1, position - 1; type - character

    The distinguished type: a character code identifying distinguished
    portfolio, distinguished institution, or distinguished account

 2. Distinguished Key: length - 24, position - 3; type - unconstrained

    The key of the holding: The unique, programmatically usable key

 3. Distinguished Foreign: length - 52, position - 28; type - unconstrained for
    portfolios and institutions; long, zero-padding to 16 characters for accounts
    (column alignment ends here)

    The foreign key of the holding: The actual, presumably sensitive portfolio
    key, an institution name, or an account number
