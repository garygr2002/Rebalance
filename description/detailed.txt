The detailed file contains optional rebalance percentages, indexed by
institution and account number. If there is an entry for a uniquely
identified account in this file, then the rebalance percentages identified in
this file override the level 1 (stocks, bonds, cash, real estate) percentages
identified in the account file.

Weights are relative only within their level categories. Level 1: stocks,
bonds, cash, or real estate; level 2: stock, bond, cash, or real estate
subtypes (stock subtypes are 'domestic' or 'foreign'); level 3: stock subtypes
large, not large, medium or small; level 4: stock subtypes growth-and-value, or
growth-or-value; level 5: stock subtypes growth or value
